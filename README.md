## In PYTHON code file
- I used Python's tkinter built-in library for the making of GUI. 
- First I defined the questions for quiz, so the user can generate them. I followed the example for questions.
- For class definition creates a graphical user interface (GUI) for a Python quiz application. 

Here is a brief description of the functions of each class method:

## init:
Initializes the quiz application, setting the window title and geometry, and creating the GUI components.

## create_widgets: 
Creates the GUI components, including labels, input fields, buttons, and frames, to display the quiz questions and options.

## generate_question:
Generates a quiz question based on the user-input topic, filters questions by topic, and updates the GUI with the question details and options.

## check_answer:
Checks the user's selected answer against the correct answer, provides feedback, and updates the GUI accordingly.

Note that this class relies on the questions list, which is not defined within the class, to provide the quiz questions and answers.
